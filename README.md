# Medal of Honor: Allied Assault Launcher
Since the official server browser went down, I decided to make my own :)

It's simple Java application displaying Medal of Honor: Allied Assault server list. Data is parsed from http://www.gametracker.com/ .

The only external library used in this program is https://jsoup.org/ - Java HTML Parser.

To start simply run compiled code. At the first run Launcher will ask you to choose directory in which game is located. You can change it later by editing config.txt file.

I've been testing this application only on Windows 10. It should also run on older versions of Windows but I'm not so optimistic about UNIX based systems.
