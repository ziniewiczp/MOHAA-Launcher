# Medal of Honor: Allied Assault Launcher
It's simple Java application displaying Medal of Honor: Allied Assault server list parsed from http://www.gametracker.com/ .

The only external library used in this program is https://jsoup.org/ - Java HTML Parser.

To start simply run compiled code in console with parameter - your MOHAA folder path. Important thing is to use double backslashes (e.g. "D:\\Games\\MOHAA").

I've been testing this application only on Windows 10. It should also run on older versions of Windows but I'm not so optimistic about UNIX based systems.
